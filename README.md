# GameQiop
It is user-friendly digital E-commerce app made using JAVA Swing. The project basically contains all the frames from welcome page to the checkout page and also storing the data of customers, date of purchase and other details in a MySQL database, connected with the help of JDBC API. 
The project requires a certain database to be created in which 3 tables are to be present to work correctly otherwise user have to manually run the Specific frame.
The version of MySQL command line client used is version 5.1.33 with adjacent JDBC driver([here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.33/mysql-connector-java-5.1.33.jar)) which has to be imported in the library. It was made by me and my two friends.
This project can run with compatible IDE which in my case was Apache NetbeansIDE with recent released JAVA JDK.
